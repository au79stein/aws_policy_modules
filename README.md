# AWS Policy Modules

## Items of Note

In no particular order... well, perhaps as I run into them?

- I don't know if I could 'force' this from the cli or by creating the policy documents directly (instead of using edit in the console) 
but if you have only one principal, AWS will not let you create a single element list.  I created a list (of one) saved it and 
AWS factors this out.  I need to test adding the 2nd principal to a policy where this is just one... I think it should work... but...
